API Challenge:

WeatherPy:

This project showcases a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.  To accomplish this, 
it uses a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

VacationPy:

The second part of this project uses the same weather data to plan future vacations. It utilizes jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to show the perfect place
for an ideal vacation!

INSTRUCTIONS:  The project can be seen by running the Jupyter notebooks.
